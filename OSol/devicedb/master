# Device tree database
#      - Records in this file can be in an arbitrary order.
#      - Records are terminated by newlines, and fields are separated
#        by any number of spaces and/or tabs.
#      - Quotes can be used in any field to allow white space.
#      - Other than comments (lines such as this beginning with '#")
#        and the "Version" string no other tokens are understood.
#
# Database format:-
#
# <dev ids> <name> <dev type> <bus> <realmode dvr> <dev desc> <properties>
#
# Where:-
#       dev ids         List of unique device identifiers, separated by the
#			"or" character '|' when more than one ID should
#			match the same entry.
#
#       name            The device name. When the device ID matches
#			an entry in the device database, the "name"
#			property is set to this value, and the "compatible"
#			property is set to the device ID. If no device
#			database entry matched, then the node will just have
#			the device ID for the "name" property. This allows
#			us to specify the Solaris driver name for a device
#			when we know what it is. PCI devices are typically
#			listed in /etc/driver_aliases so we just map the
#			name back to the device ID and let driver_aliases
#			take care of the driver name mapping.
#
#       dev type        The device type.  Valid values are:
#
#			    com  ...  Serial ports
# 			    mem  ...  Memory extender cards
#			    mfc  ...  Multi-function card
#			    msd  ...  Mass storage device (eg scsi or ide)
#			    net  ...  Network devices
#			    plat ...  Platform bef
#			    oth  ...  Miscellaneous (including sound cards)
#			    ptr  ...  Mice, etc.
#			    vid  ...  Video/graphics cards
#			    prt  ...  Parallel ports
#
#       bus             The bus type (eg all, isa, pnpisa, eisa, pci)
#
#       realmode dvr    The realmode driver for bootable devices,
#                       otherwise "none".
#                       Note, realmode driver is no longer being used.
#                       The entry is there for backward compatibility.
#
#       dev desc        Freeform descriptive device text
#
#       properties      Optional additional device properties of the form
#                       name=value eg ipl=3. Properties are added to the
#                       device tree node passed to the kernel. This field
#			is also used to make this database "extensible".
#			Properties which begin with a dollar sign are
#			are used to pass information to the Configuration
#			Assistant, but are not added to the device tree.
#			For example, the $forceload property tells the
#			Configuration Assistant that it must always load
#			the specified bef in order for that bef to set
#			additional properties on the node.
#
#
# ISA/EISA devices
# id is the config file name (without leading "!" and trailing ".cfg")
